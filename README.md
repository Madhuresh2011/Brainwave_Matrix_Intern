# FOR TASK 2

- Social Media Sentiment Analysis

- Analyze social media data (e.g., Twitter) to understand public sentiment towards specific topics, products, or events. Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data, extract sentiment scores, and visualize sentiment trends over time.



## Project Overview

- This project focuses on analyzing social media data to determine the sentiment of user posts. 
- The objective is to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.


## Features

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, and normalization)

- Sentiment classification using machine learning models

- Data visualization of sentiment distribution

- Model evaluation using accuracy metrics



## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization



## Dataset

- The dataset consists of social media posts collected from platforms like Twitter. It includes labeled data for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.
